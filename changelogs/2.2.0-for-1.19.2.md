## Backported YACL 2.2.0 to 1.19.2

Due to breaking JAR compatibility in an earlier version of YACL, mods that support YACL for
1.19.3 can no longer support 1.19.2. This is a backport of YACL 2.2.0 to 1.19.2 to allow mods to
support it.

### My stance on backporting

Personally, I hate to backport my mods. When breaking changes are made in Minecraft between versions,
the code of the mod has to be changed to support the new version, making the older version of MC incompatible.
If you want to support multiple versions of Minecraft, you have to maintain multiple branches of the mod, which
is a lot of work for just one person, and I don't have the time to do that.

This is a one-off backport, and I will not be backporting any future versions of YACL to 1.19.2. If you want to
support and use new features of YACL in your mod, you will have to drop support for 1.19.2.
