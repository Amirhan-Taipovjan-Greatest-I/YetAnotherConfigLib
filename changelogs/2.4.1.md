## Features

- `OptionGroup.Builder` and `ConfigCategory.Builder` now extend `OptionAddable` so you can abstractly
add options to either of them.

## API Changes

- Deprecated the varargs tooltip builder method in `Option.Builder` due to unsafe varargs. There is now
  an equivalent that is not varargs but a single function.
